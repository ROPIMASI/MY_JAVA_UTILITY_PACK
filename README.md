#### Versioning
In a team project, it is very important to know and follow the specifications of the project version. Although at the moment MyUtility's status is under early development (as it has not its first release version yet 1.0.0-release) its project already is designed under [**SemVer** (Semantic Versioning Specification)](http://semver.org/).  
Thus, MyUtility uses **_SemVer_** for its versioning. **SemVer** is a specification (set of rules) that tells (or dictates) us how to use the numbers (and some letters) on the _versioning-expression_ (VerExpr). More specifically, MyUtility uses the following standardization: _Major.Minor.Patch-ReleaseStatus+Build_, where:  
* The standard values of _Major_, _Minor_, and _Patch_ for the _VerExpr_ are as follows:
  + Positive integer decimal numbers, without zero remaining on the left;
  + Major version represents wider changes in the project, which affects the main structure of the project, or its main objectives, or the last user API released;
  + Minor version represents smaller changes in the project, which don't affect above itens, but affect the amount of the application fuatrures with a new one or more, or remove an existing feature previouslly released;
  + Patch version represents specific changes which goals to fix or improve some feature, or undesired behavior in the application.  
* The standard flags of _ReleaseStatus_ for the _VerExpr_ are as follows:
  + **_dev_**: in early development, usage not encouraged;
  + **_alpha_**: in development, first test phase, it's encouraged usage for **test only** by people involved with software development, at self-own risk;
  + **_beta_**: in pre-release version, general public usage is acceptable, however, **only for test**, usage is a choice at self-own risk;
  + **_release_**: release version; relatively stable in proportion to the effectiveness of the tests; bugs are possible to appear, so it would come back to a _hotfix-branch_ if needed.
* The standard values of _Build_ for the _VerExpr_ are as follows:
  + ...
  + ...
  + ...
